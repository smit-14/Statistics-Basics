Explain the different types of data (qualitative and quantitative) and provide examples of each. Discuss nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales.\n","\n","- Qualitative data (Categorical) describes characteristics or qualities and cannot be measured numerically. Examples: colors, gender, nationality.\n","\n","- Quantitative data (Numerical) consists of measurable values. Examples: height, weight, income.\n","\n","- Nominal scale: Categorical data without any order (e.g., eye color, gender).\n","\n","- Ordinal scale: Categorical data with a meaningful order (e.g., rankings, survey ratings).\n","\n","- Interval scale: Numeric data with equal intervals but no true zero (e.g., temperature in Celsius).\n","\n","- Ratio scale: Numeric data with a true zero, allowing for meaningful ratios (e.g., weight, height, income).\n","\n","2. What are the measures of central tendency, and when should you use each? Discuss the mean, median, and mode with examples and situations where each is appropriate.\n","\n","- Mean: The average of all data points. Best for symmetric distributions without outliers (e.g., average test scores).\n","\n","- Median: The middle value in an ordered dataset. Best when dealing with skewed distributions (e.g., income data).\n","\n","- Mode: The most frequently occurring value. Useful for categorical data or identifying common trends (e.g., most common shoe size).\n","\n","3. Explain the concept of dispersion. How do variance and standard deviation measure the spread of data?\n","\n","- Dispersion refers to how spread out the data points are.\n","\n","- Variance: Measures the average squared deviation from the mean.\n","\n","- Standard deviation: The square root of variance, representing the typical deviation from the mean.\n","\n","4. What is a box plot, and what can it tell you about the distribution of data?\n","\n","- A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) displays data distribution, showing the median, quartiles, and potential outliers.\n","\n","- It provides insights into skewness, spread, and outliers in the dataset.\n","\n","5. Discuss the role of random sampling in making inferences about populations.\n","\n","- Random sampling ensures every individual has an equal chance of selection, reducing bias.\n","\n","- It helps in making unbiased estimates about a population based on sample data.\n","\n","- Techniques include simple random sampling, stratified sampling, and cluster sampling.\n","\n","6. Explain the concept of skewness and its types. How does skewness affect the interpretation of data?\n","\n","- Skewness describes asymmetry in data distribution.\n","\n","- Positive skew: Tail on the right, with the mean greater than the median (e.g., income distribution).\n","\n","- Negative skew: Tail on the left, with the mean less than the median (e.g., age of retirement).\n","\n","- Skewness impacts measures of central tendency and data interpretation.\n","\n","7. What is the interquartile range (IQR), and how is it used to detect outliers?\n","\n","- IQR = Q3 - Q1, where Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile) define the middle 50% of data.\n","\n","- Outliers are values below Q1 - 1.5 √ó IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 √ó IQR.\n","\n","8. Discuss the conditions under which the binomial distribution is used.\n","\n","- The binomial distribution applies when:\n","\n","  - There are n independent trials.\n","\n","  - Each trial has two possible outcomes (success or failure).\n","\n","  - The probability of success (p) is constant for all trials.\n","\n","  - The trials are independent.\n","\n","9. Explain the properties of the normal distribution and the empirical rule (68-95-99.7 rule).\n","\n","- Normal distribution is symmetric, bell-shaped, and characterized by mean (Œº) and standard deviation (œÉ).\n","\n","- Empirical Rule:\n","\n","    68% of data falls within 1œÉ of the mean.\n","\n","    95% falls within 2œÉ.\n","\n","    99.7% falls within 3œÉ.\n","\n","10. Provide a real-life example of a Poisson process and calculate the probability for a specific event.\n","\n","- Example: Number of customer calls received per hour in a call center.\n","\n","- Poisson probability formula:\n","\n","    ùëÉ\n","(\n","ùëã\n","=\n","ùëò\n",")\n","=\n","ùëí\n","‚àí\n","ùúÜ\n","ùúÜ\n","ùëò\n","ùëò\n","!\n","P(X=k)=\n","k!\n","e\n","‚àíŒª\n"," Œª\n","k\n","- where Œª is the average rate and k is the number of occurrences.\n","\n","11. Explain what a random variable is and differentiate between discrete and continuous random variables.\n","\n","- A random variable assigns numerical values to outcomes of a random process.\n","\n","- Discrete random variables: Countable values (e.g., number of students in a class).\n","\n","- Continuous random variables: Infinite possible values (e.g., height, temperature).\n","\n","12. Provide an example dataset, calculate both covariance and correlation, and interpret the results.\n","\n","- Example dataset:\n","\n","    X = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n","    \n","    Y = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15]\n","\n","- Covariance measures how two variables change together.\n","\n","- Correlation standardizes covariance, ranging from -1 to 1.\n","\n","- A positive correlation indicates a direct relationship, while negative correlation suggests an inverse relationship.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"7P9JFsqIPIpU"}}]}
